Political Science and Causal Inference:
Does College Matter? A Propensity Score Matching Approach to Assessing the Effects of College Attendance on Political Participa
• Objective: Assess the causal effects of college education on political par-
ticipation.
• Methodology & Instrument: Application of propensity score matching
and genetic matching to mitigate selection bias and assess causality.
• Reason: To improve upon previous research methodologies that failed to
find a correlation between college attendance and political participation
due to selection bias.
• Data: Utilization of data sets comparing individuals who attended college
to those who did not, adjusting for various covariates.
• Results: Consistently finds positive effects of college education on politi-
cal participation as covariate balance is enhanced, highlighting the impor-
tance of addressing selection bias in causal inference studies.
