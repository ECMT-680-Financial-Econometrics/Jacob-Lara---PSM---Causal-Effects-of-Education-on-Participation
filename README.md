\textbf{Political Science and Causal Inference: \footnotesize \textsuperscript\ \href{file-J0DJE8kT2QRjMs4cDfF3C4uE}{Does College Matter? A Propensity Score Matching Approach to Assessing the Effects of College Attendance on Political Participation}, Authors Not Specified, \textit{Journal Not Specified}, Publication Year Not Specified}

\begin{itemize} \scriptsize
\item Objective: Assess the causal effects of college education on political participation.
\item Methodology & Instrument: Application of propensity score matching and genetic matching to mitigate selection bias and assess causality.
\item Reason: To improve upon previous research methodologies that failed to find a correlation between college attendance and political participation due to selection bias.
\item Data: Utilization of data sets comparing individuals who attended college to those who did not, adjusting for various covariates.
\item Results: Consistently finds positive effects of college education on political participation as covariate balance is enhanced, highlighting the importance of addressing selection bias in causal inference studies.
\end{itemize}
